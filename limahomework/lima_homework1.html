<body>
<!-- I changed <BODY> to <body>. HTML5 standard doesn't require lowercase tag, but W3schools recommended to use always use lowercase tags. Developers normally use lowercase names (as in XHTML) and it looks cleaner. Finally, it is bad to mix uppercase and lowercase names. --> 
    <h1>CNIT-132 Homework 1</h1>
<!-- I changed </H1> to </h1> for the same reason that I explained above. I wanted to use a consistent style. I excluded style=text-align:center because the align attribute is obsolete in HTML5. -->
    <p>In this homework we will be changing this code to be a valid code in HTML5.</p>
<!-- I inserted </p>. In HTML5, you don't have to close all elements like <p> element, but it's recommended to close all HTML elements. If you forget the <p> element, it might produce unexpected results and/or delays.-->
    <p>We will probably need to change a lot of details around the code and the basic idea of this Homework is to learn how to use the validator from W3C.</p>
    <p><img style="float:left;" SRC="oldboat.gif" alt="The image of an old boat that was used to transport heavy cargo in the old times.">The image you see here will be used a lot in many exercises we will be doing in class! This is an old boat, probably an old ship. One of those types used to transport heavy cargo in the old times?!?! Of course this picture is not real, but you can imagine a big boat made basically of wood and using the main power of the wind! Remember that this picture needs to be uploaded to the Hills Server (your account) together with this file you are modifying, otherwise, the picture will not be shown!
<!-- I inserted an alt attribute to make my website accessible. Alt attribute provides alternative information for an image if a user for some reason cannot view it. -->

<!-- I changed <H2></H2> to <h2></h2> because it's recommended to use lowercase. And I wanted to use a consistent style. -->
    <p>It's funny to see this page being upgraded<br>
    We will be dealing with a lot of details in this code<br>
    and that's the idea of this exercise!</p>
    <p>I am trying to build an unordered list here below. Would you be able to help me?</p>
    <ul>
        <li> planning a web page</li>
        <li> studying the target audience</li>
        <li> following standards when coding</li>
    </ul>
<!-- I built an unordered list. It contains the unordered list element <ul> and list item element <li>. I deleted - because unordered list displays information with bullet points. -->
    <p>Make sure you upload your file to Hills, inside the public_html folder, make sure also to upload the image of the oldboat but, especially for his work, make sure you validate your code!</p>
